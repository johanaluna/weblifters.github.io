A cancer incidence rate is the number of new cancers of a specific site/type occurring in a specified population during a year,usually expressed as the number of cancers per 100,000 population at risk.

[*](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/statistics/types/incidence.html)Incidence rate = (New cancers / Population) Ã— 100,000.

Between 1999 and 2015, overall **cancer incidence rates have increased 28.3 percent in United Sates.**

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
