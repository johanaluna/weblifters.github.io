A cancer incidence rate is the number of new cancers of a specific site/type occurring in a specified population during a year, usually expressed as the number of cancers per *100,000* population at risk.

[(1)](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/statistics/types/incidence.html)*Incidence rate = (New cancers / Population) × 100,000.*

Between 1999 and 2015, overall **cancer incidence rates have increased 28.3 percent in United Sates.**

**Georgia, North Carolina and Tenesse were the states with the higher cancer incidence rate** between 1999 and 2015.

However, **California, Florida and New York are the states with the highest cancer prevalence**, which means the highest concentration of cancer population.

I want to explore the state of New York, because is the state where I am currently living. The following graph shows the rate of incidence of Cancer in the state of New York since 1999 to 2015.


Since 1999 the **Incidence of Cancer in New York has increased 19,72%** (See table below)

![Cancer4](/img/cancer_incidence/4_cancer.png)

This is substantial increase. For reference between 2010–2015 **cancer incidence in New York has increased 5% while the population only increased 1% :**

Additionally, the following 5 cancer sites had the highest incidence for the analyzed period of time.

![Cancer6](/img/cancer_incidence/6_cancer.png)

Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to show the rate evolution over time.

![Cancer7](/img/cancer_incidence/7_cancer.png)

Surprisingly, **the cancer sites with the highest cancer incidence have not changed over time.**

As a final point, I tested if the cancer mean is equal to the population mean in United States(this is my null hypothesis). For this reason, the test chosen to compare these two means is test_1samp; this is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis.

As a result, I reject my null hypothesis. We cannot conclude that the cancer incidence and the population of United Sates are dependent.

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .center-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
